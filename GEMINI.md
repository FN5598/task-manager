# Project: setup-zero

This Task Manager project is a React + Vite application designed to help users organize and track their daily activities efficiently. The core idea is to provide a simple, intuitive interface where users can create tasks, mark them as completed, edit them, delete them, and categorize them based on importance or deadlines. The project aims to make task management lightweight and fast by using a modern frontend stack (React + Vite) and clean component architecture.

The UI focuses on clarity and accessibility: tasks are displayed in a structured list, optionally grouped by priority or date. Users can interact with each task directly through buttons or inline controls. There is also a theme toggle system (light/dark), making the app comfortable to use in different environments. The design emphasizes clean styling, responsive layout, and smooth state updates using React hooks.

The vision for the project is to eventually support features such as persistent storage (localStorage or backend API), filtering/searching tasks, drag-and-drop reordering, reminders, and user profiles. It is built to be easily extensible and acts as a foundation for a more advanced personal productivity tool.
